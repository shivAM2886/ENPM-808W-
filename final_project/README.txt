InitialCleanUp_2.R			(Wrote By Justin) Used to clean the data initially (stripped fields we didn't care about out of the data)
Exploration.R				(Wrote By Justin) (NOT USED FOR CLASSIFIER) Used to Analyze the data
Final_Data_PlayGround.R		(Wrote By Justin) (NOT USED FOR CLASSIFIER) Further cleaned up the data for More Analysis

VisaZipCodes.Rmd			(Wrote By Corbyn) (NOT USED FOR CLASSIFIER) Used to plot the US maps with the zipcodes of the employers
ExploratoryAnalysis.Rmd		(Wrote By Corbyn) (NOT USED FOR CLASSIFIER) Plotting and evaluating/Analyzing data
ComparisionClassifier.ipynb	(Wrote By Shivam) Created to do the final classification process to test our data and to analyze our sampling methods. This was tried initially in R but we couldnt get R to work so we did it in Python 
FinalClassifier.ipynb		(Wrote By Shivam) Code wrote to create our final classifier we used (partly made in ComparisonClassifier.ipynb)
ComparisionClassifier.html	(Wrote By Shivam) Same as its respective ipynb file but the HTML printout
FinalClassifier.html		(Wrote By Shivam) Same as its respective ipynb file but the HTML printout
us_perm_visas.csv		(final Data set) Data used in ComparisonClassifier.ipynb and FinalClassifier.ipynb (output of InitialCleanUp.py and InitialCleanUp_2.R)
