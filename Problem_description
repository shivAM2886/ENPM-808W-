New York Times (50 points, Adapted from Rachel Schutt at Columbia) 

There are 31 datasets named nyt1.csv, nyt2.csv,...,nyt31.csv.Each one represents one day’s worth of ad
impressions and clicks on the New York Times homepage in May, 2012 (these are simulated). 
Each row represents a single user. 

There are 5 columns: age, gender (0=female, 1=male), number of impressions
(page views), number clicks (actions) and whether the user was logged.in.
WARNING: These data are designed to simulate real data.

a. Create a new variable, age_group, that categorizes users as “<18”, ”18-24”, ”25-
34”, ”35-44”, ”45-54”, “55-64” and “65+”.

b. For a single day

i. Plot the distributions of number impressions and click-through-rate
(CTR=# clicks/# impressions), for these 6 age categories. 
ii. Define a new variable to segment or categorize users based on their click
behavior

(The remaining questions require you to be creative and come with you your own
variables/parameters/metrics are required in the question.)

iii. Explore the data and make visual and quantitative comparisons across
user segments/ demographics 

c. Create metrics/measurements/statistics that summarize the data. Examples of
potential metrics include CTR, quantiles, mean, median, variance, max, and
these can be calculated across the various user segments. Be selective. Think
about what will be important to track over time; what will compress the data, but
still capture user behavior. Now extend your analysis across days (one week is
sufficient). Visualize metrics and distributions over time. Your plot should
emphasize what actually changes over days.

d. Describe and interpret any patterns you find.
